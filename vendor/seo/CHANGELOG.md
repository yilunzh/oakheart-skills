# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.1] - 2026-09-29

Google-currency patch. Every changed fact was re-checked against its
primary source between 2026-09-28 and 2026-09-29; claims that could not be
confirmed on a Google-owned page are recorded in `unverified[]` or labelled
as third-party instead of being stated as fact.

### Added

- Ledger (`data/google-updates.json`): the September 2026 Spam Update
  (started 2026-09-24, still rolling out when this release was cut; Google
  estimates up to two weeks and named no target), the August 2025 Spam
  Update, VideoObject `creator` and the `interactionStatistic` action types,
  Search Console multimodal reporting, Merchant Center AI performance
  insights, the UCP integration hub cart transfer, Gemini 3.8 Flash in AI
  Mode for subscribers, and CrUX experimental ad metrics.
- `unverified[]` entries so audits do not encode them: SAFE ("The Synthetic
  Gap" is a Google paper about YouTube spam networks and never mentions
  Search), the claim that the September spam update excludes link spam,
  vendor volatility readings, a "September 2026 Authority Signals Update"
  (refuted: no such incident on the Search Status Dashboard), a JSON-LD
  parsing report, and AI Mode SERP tests.
- `pagespeed_check.py` reports `lighthouse_version`, the Lighthouse build
  PSI actually ran (13.5.0 on 2026-09-29).
- Tests: `test_no_em_dash.py`, `test_file_size_limits.py` (SKILL.md 500
  lines, references 200), and eight new canonical-fact guards, each failing
  on the v2.4.0 wording it replaces. The ledger host allowlist adds
  `developer.chrome.com` and `static.googleusercontent.com` (the full QRG PDF).

### Changed

- Skills: the Search generative AI control covers Discover gen-AI features
  and is separate from `Google-Extended`; `Google-Extended` covers Gemini
  training and grounding and training of the models behind Search gen-AI
  features, with no effect on Search inclusion or ranking; the multimodal
  search type is a UI and export filter with no verified API `type`; local
  business queries in EEA aggregator and supplier units reach seo-ecommerce.
- Re-verified and corrected: URL Inspection `mobileUsabilityResult` is
  deprecated; the AI optimization guide dates (published 2026-05-15,
  llms.txt clarified 2026-06-15, last updated 2026-07-10); JavaScript
  structured data guidance (dynamic Product markup can slow Shopping
  crawls); ProfilePage and DiscussionForumPosting dates, Speakable still
  beta; I/O 2026 wording and summer rollouts marked as announced; Gemini
  image model names and shutdowns (the `-preview` image IDs retired
  2026-06-25, `gemini-2.5-flash-image` retires 2026-10-02); AI Mode 1B+
  monthly users is Google-stated; FTC review penalty unchanged for 2026;
  ChatGPT 1B+ weekly users; Ahrefs and Profound study dates; caniuse AVIF
  and WebP figures.
- Third-party claims are labelled as such: update-table impact text (Google
  confirms rollout dates, not targets), the Sterling Sky 18-day finding (a
  case example, not a rule), local AI Overview coverage (0.14% and 68% shown
  together with their methods), the June 2025 manual-action wave, and the
  late-2024 publisher site-reputation reports.
- The `/seo` orchestrator routes Google update-history questions to the
  bundled ledger (`seo_updates.py`), so answers no longer depend on whatever
  older copy the model finds on disk.
- Six reference files over 200 lines were split at section boundaries into
  sibling files, with no content removed.
- Em dashes removed from skills, agents, scripts, extensions and docs.
- Python 3.10 reaches end of life in October 2026; the docs now recommend
  3.11 or newer. The floor is unchanged in this patch.
- `google_report.py` PDFs, `lcp_subparts.py` text output and the installer
  banners no longer print em dashes; `gsc_inspect.py` flags the deprecated
  `mobile_usability` field. The README v2.2.1 note now dates the Agentic
  Browsing category to Lighthouse 13.2.0. The banana extension's prompt
  reference is split the same way as the core copy.

### Fixed

- `seo_updates.py --kind spam` and `--kind core` now include the combined
  March 2024 core+spam rollout.
- Site reputation regional enforcement is dated from its effective date,
  2026-08-30 (announced 2026-08-28), in `parasite_risk.py` and the skills.
- Ledger: the December 2024 spam update no longer claims a scaled-content
  target; the November 2024 core update records its 23-day rollout; the QRG
  entries cite the full guidelines PDF instead of the 2023 overview.
- local-seo-signals: the August 2026 spam update ended August 21.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- New `seo-agentic` sub-skill and `seo-agentic` audit agent (`/seo agentic
  [audit|fix|lighthouse|refresh] <url>`) for agent readiness. Three scripts:
  `lighthouse_agentic.py` reads the Lighthouse Agentic Browsing category
  through PSI v5 (`category=AGENTIC_BROWSING`) or a saved report and
  reproduces the report renderer's fraction exactly (N/A, manual and
  informative audits excluded, pass at score 0.9), with per-audit status and
  the changes that add a counted audit; `agentic_check.py` checks server
  rendering, RFC 9309 robots.txt group selection per AI agent and
  Content-Signal, llms.txt with Lighthouse parity, Markdown delivery
  (`Accept: text/markdown` with `Vary: Accept`, `.md` alternates),
  `ai-catalog.json` discovery and ARD conformance, `/.well-known`
  documents (RFC 9727, 9728, 8414, A2A), WebMCP markup, and, only with
  `--ua-matrix`, responses to AI agent user agents; `agentic_fix.py` drafts
  Content-Signal lines for every robots.txt group without touching
  Allow/Disallow, llms.txt, `ai-catalog.json`, and WebMCP tools bound to each
  form's own submit handler. Every request goes through `url_safety`. Facts
  were verified on 2026-09-23 against the Lighthouse 13.5.0 source, live PSI
  runs, the WebMCP spec draft, and vendor bot documentation, and the dated,
  source-graded vendor matrix lives in one reference file. Full audits now
  spawn `seo-agentic` alongside `seo-geo`, writing `findings/agentic.md`.

- New optional Matomo extension (`extensions/matomo/`) for self-hosted or
  Matomo Cloud analytics. Adds `/seo matomo organic | top-pages | device
  | country | referrers | keywords` as a GA4 alternative or complement.
  The audit orchestrator spawns a new `seo-matomo` agent when
  `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-seo" run matomo_auth.py --check`
  succeeds, writing `findings/matomo.md` alongside the existing specialists.
  Response parsing is verified live against Matomo 5, including array-shaped
  DataTables, count-based bounce fields, `Referrers.getReferrerType` naming,
  and locale-independent anonymized-keyword detection via the row `segment`
  field. Credentials live in `~/.config/claude-seo/matomo.json` (0600, written
  atomically), with the `MATOMO_URL` / `MATOMO_API_TOKEN` / `MATOMO_SITE_ID`
  environment variables still taking precedence. Every request to the instance
  goes through `url_safety`'s DNS-pinned helpers; a self-hosted instance on a
  private address is reached by naming it in `CLAUDE_SEO_LOCAL_TARGETS`, which
  both installers print at install time, and a redirect away from the instance
  is refused rather than followed. Contributed by Tim J. Peters (#275).

### Security

- **Extension installers no longer put secrets on the command line.** Every
  `extensions/*/install.sh` that writes credentials, and the four
  `install.ps1` files that hand credentials to Python (profound, seranking,
  bing-webmaster, matomo), passed API keys, tokens and passwords to Python as arguments, readable by any local user through
  `ps`. They now travel in the environment (`CLAUDE_SEO_SECRET` and
  friends), which only the same user can read; PowerShell clears the
  variables afterwards. Found while reviewing #305, whose installer shares
  the flaw.
- **Installers no longer wipe a malformed config.** Seven shell writers and
  three PowerShell writers reset
  `~/.claude.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json` to `{}` when the file failed
  to parse and wrote that back, deleting the user's whole Claude Code
  configuration. They now exit with "Nothing was changed". The PowerShell
  writers check `$LASTEXITCODE`, so they no longer print "Done." after the
  refusal.
- The banana `setup_mcp.py` and `validate_setup.py` checks printed the first
  eight characters of the Google AI key as well as the last four. They now
  show only the last four. Found by CodeQL, now enabled on the repository.
- `keywordseverywhere_api.py` could echo the API key in an error when the
  stored key had a trailing newline (pre-existing). Keys are stripped,
  rejected if they contain control characters, and every error is redacted.

### Fixed

- The ahrefs and dataforseo PowerShell installers failed to parse on
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 (pre-existing). 5.1 reads a script without a BOM as
  ANSI, so their check-mark and box symbols broke the string quoting; pwsh was
  unaffected. Every shipped `.ps1` file is now ASCII, a test enforces it, and
  CI parses every extension script on both PowerShell versions; the Matomo
  credential writer prints plain ASCII so it runs under a cp1252 console.

- UTF-8 pages served as `text/html` without a charset were decoded as
  ISO-8859-1 in seven scripts (`render_page`, `parse_html`, `nlp_analyze`,
  `preload_check`, `parasite_risk`, `ucp_check`, `gbp_deprecation_lint`).
  One decoder, `url_safety.decode_response_text` / `decode_body`, now
  serves every fetch. (#314)
- The Keywords Everywhere fallback called a removed endpoint and never
  worked; it now uses `POST /v1/domains/bulk` with Bearer auth. Verified
  against the API docs and with an invalid key (documented 401); not yet
  exercised with a valid key. (#312)
- Skills named DataForSEO tools the pinned `dataforseo-mcp-server@2.8.10`
  does not have (`dataforseo_backlinks_*`, `on_page_content_parsing_live`,
  `serp_google_images_live_advanced`), and `serp-images` was advertised as a
  full Google Images SERP. A fixture of the pinned server's 80 tool names now
  guards every skill. (#317)
- Cross-skill reference paths in agents and skills are anchored to
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (manual installs rewrite them to the absolute
  skills directory), so subagents no longer search the disk for paths they
  cannot resolve. This removes one trigger for #252; the orphaned-process
  cleanup it reports is Claude Code behaviour, not fixed here.
- `ucp_check.py` rejected real, spec-conformant UCP profiles ("0
  capabilities, 3 structural issues"); it now parses the ucp.dev shape.
- Hostile or malformed content that crashed `agentic_check`, `ucp_check`,
  `keywordseverywhere_api` and `lighthouse_agentic` (deeply nested JSON,
  non-string UCP endpoints and transports, unexpected API bodies, malformed
  Lighthouse categories, non-string ARD types and audit ids, BOM-prefixed
  reports) now produces a finding; each shape found in two audit passes and a
  random-shape fuzz has a test, and a seeded fuzz runs in the suite. robots.txt is split on CR/LF
  only, so a Unicode line separator inside a comment no longer becomes a rule.
- `render_page` keeps the raw status, headers and URL when Chromium fails,
  and `agent_ux_check` falls back to raw-HTML findings with the score left
  unavailable.
- Facts re-verified against primary sources (2026-09-23): Claude-User
  honours robots.txt; PerplexityBot is not a training crawler; good TTFB is
  0.8s or less; Book actions markup is not deprecated; the 2025-09-09
  tooling removal dates; CrUX LCP image subparts; the AI optimization
  guide's real wording and its Search Console "Search generative AI"
  control; aggregator and supplier units are EEA-only; GBP Q&A API
  discontinued; Google-GeminiNotebook; Gemini model naming; Content API for
  Shopping sunset; Privacy Sandbox retirements; soft navigations; schema.org
  30.1; UCP 2026-08-25. `tests/test_canonical_facts.py` keeps each
  disproved statement out of the skills.

### Changed

- **Breaking (`keywordseverywhere_api.py` output):** `page_rank_integer` is
  removed and `rank` is now the API's global rank (an integer), no longer a
  0-10 string. New fields: `open_page_rank`, `found`, `referring_domains`,
  `as_of`, `invalid`. `page_rank_decimal` remains as an alias of
  `open_page_rank`.
- **Breaking (`ucp_check.py` output):** `parse.merchant` is removed (the spec
  has no such field); capability entries no longer carry `endpoint`, which
  moved to `parse.services`; a flat, non-spec profile reports
  `missing-ucp-root`; the summary reads "UCP <version>, N capabilities";
  `--probe-endpoints` probes service endpoints with GET.
- **Breaking (installers):** an unparseable settings file now makes the
  installer exit non-zero instead of overwriting it.
- `agentic_check.py` adds an `http-404` check: a host that answers unknown
  paths with 200 makes Lighthouse fail `llms-txt` and `ard-schema`.
- `seo_updates.py --json` adds `freshness` (stale after 30 days); text mode
  also warns on stderr; `seo-audit`, `seo-content` and `seo-geo` now correlate traffic
  changes with the ledger, which gains 8 entries and `last_verified`
  2026-09-23.
- Dependency floors raised: `lxml_html_clean` 0.4.5 (advisories fixed in
  0.4.4 and 0.4.5), `trafilatura` 2.2.0, `htmldate` 1.10.0,
  `google-auth-httplib2` 0.4.2, `google-ads` 31.4.0. Supersedes #307 to #311.
- `pdf/google-seo-reference.md` is removed: it declared itself deprecated,
  nothing loaded it, and it shipped a stale copy into manual installs.
- `seo-technical` drops rel=next/prev pagination advice and unsourced
  figures; `seo-geo` labels passage length as a heuristic, gives llms.txt no
  score weight and scores only platforms a tool measured; `seo-ecommerce`
  requires a merchant-listing price above zero; `seo-schema` flags JSON-LD
  blocks without `@context` or `@type`.
- `agent-friendly-pages.md` moved from `seo-technical` to `seo-agentic` and
  was rewritten for Lighthouse 13.5.0: the category has seven audits
  (`agent-accessibility-tree` aggregates 33 axe rules; `ard-schema` validates
  `ai-catalog.json`), not three accessibility audits. `seo-technical` now
  points to `/seo agentic`, and the Lighthouse notes in `seo-performance`
  and `cwv-thresholds.md` name 13.5.0.
- Counts corrected to what is on disk: 26 sub-skills, 19 sub-agents, 60
  scripts, up to 17 parallel audit agents.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Keywords Everywhere (Open PageRank) as an optional, free-signup backlinks
  fallback source: a single 0-10 domain rank metric used for the Profile
  Overview section when Moz isn't configured. Wired through
  `backlinks_auth.py` (new `keywordseverywhere` service) and a new
  `keywordseverywhere_api.py` client, following the existing Moz/Bing auth
  and source patterns. The outbound call goes through the shared
  `url_safety.safe_requests_get` DNS-pinned helper, domains are normalized
  and SSRF-checked before use, and requests are capped at 100 domains per
  call. `keywordseverywhere_api.py` is registered in `runtime.py`'s
  `ALLOWED_CORE_SCRIPTS` (a script invoked from a SKILL.md but missing from
  that allowlist is refused by `claude-seo run`; a new test in
  `tests/test_runtime.py` guards against that class of bug for every
  script every SKILL.md/agent invokes). The live API path is unverified:
  landing this required no Keywords Everywhere account, and none was
  available to exercise the real endpoint end to end (#262).

### Changed

- The five judgment-heavy agents (`seo-content`, `seo-geo`, `seo-sxo`, `seo-cluster`,
  `seo-drift`) declare `model: opus`; the other thirteen stay on Sonnet. README
  documents the cost implication and how to override per agent (#268).
- Applied the mechanical hunks from #196 ("ponytail cleanup") by hand: hoisted
  three function-local `from urllib.parse import urlparse` imports to the top of
  `validate_backlink_report.py`, and deleted `commoncrawl_graph.py`'s dead
  `_stream_gz_lines` helper (zero callers) along with the `gzip`/`io` imports it
  alone used. Left out the `hashlib.file_digest` rewrite (Python 3.11+ only;
  `pyproject.toml` requires >=3.10) and narrowing `dataforseo_normalize.py`'s
  `--module` choices, a compatibility change rather than a cleanup. Credit:
  pookNast (#196).

### Fixed

- `metadata_template.py`, added in v2.3.0, was not registered in the launcher's
  `ALLOWED_CORE_SCRIPTS`, so `claude-seo run metadata_template.py` was refused for
  `/seo page` and `/seo programmatic`. Registered, with a test that every script an
  instruction file invokes is allowlisted.
- The dataforseo, ahrefs and firecrawl PowerShell installers created `mcpServers` as
  a hashtable, which `ConvertTo-Json` serialised as `{}` when `~/.claude.json` was
  missing or had no `mcpServers` yet, silently dropping the server entry; they now
  create an object. They also wrote the file with a byte-order mark on Windows
  PowerShell 5.1, which Node's JSON parser rejects; the write is BOM-free now.
- `_run_checked` discarded a failing setup stage's stderr/stdout, so a broken
  venv or pip install reported only "failed with exit code 1" with nothing
  actionable. It now surfaces a bounded tail of the child's own output, pip is
  bootstrapped as its own stage (`venv --without-pip` + `ensurepip`) so its
  diagnostics are no longer swallowed by `venv`, and home-directory redaction
  covers repr-quoted and mixed-case forms child tracebacks print. Also fixed a
  gap the same change opened: the non-fatal "Browser setup incomplete" warning
  printed the raw exception instead of the redacted one, so a failing Chromium
  install could leak the home directory through the one message that wasn't
  routed through `_redact` (#300, Nordalux).
- `extensions/dataforseo/install.ps1` and `extensions/ahrefs/install.ps1` merged
  their MCP server entry with an embedded Python heredoc (`tempfile.mkstemp` +
  `os.replace`), and `extensions/firecrawl/uninstall.ps1` wrote
  `ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10` straight to `~/.claude.json` with no temp file. All
  three now follow the native `ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100` + temp-file +
  `Move-Item -Force` pattern v2.3.0 established in
  `extensions/firecrawl/install.ps1`; `ahrefs/install.ps1` no longer requires
  Python as a result.
- The `anthropic-ai` crawler row v2.3.0 added to `skills/seo-geo/SKILL.md` and
  `agents/seo-geo.md`, marked unverified, still does not appear on Anthropic's
  crawler support article (confirmed by re-fetching it: only ClaudeBot,
  Claude-User, and Claude-SearchBot are documented), so the row is removed
  rather than kept as an unverifiable guess.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-10

### Security

- A configured HTTP proxy is validated before it is exempted from the DNS-pinned
  scope. The proxy host `requests` selects for a URL is exempt from the
  fall-through check so the tunnel can be opened, but that host is read from the
  environment, so `HTTPS_PROXY=http://169.254.169.254:3128` turned every audit
  into a cloud-metadata read. The proxy now goes through the hostname blocklist
  and `is_safe_ip` on every address it resolves to, and a proxy on loopback,
  RFC 1918, RFC 6598, link-local, or a metadata address is refused with an error
  naming the address. This narrows #280: a loopback CONNECT proxy is no longer
  trusted. (#280, #295)
- `CLAUDE_SEO_LOCAL_TARGETS` allows auditing a local dev server, a staging host,
  or a machine reached over Tailscale, without the blanket "allow private"
  switch that would follow any private URL found on a crawled page. It is a
  comma-separated list of `host` or `host:port` entries, consulted only for the
  first, top-level URL. Redirect targets, subresources, and the Playwright route
  handler stay fail-closed; cloud metadata endpoints are refused even when
  listed; `is_safe_ip` reads no environment. Unset, the policy is unchanged.
  Documented in SECURITY.md and the `seo-technical` skill. (#211)
- All 14 agents that fetch or render external content (via `fetch_page`,
  `render_page`, `parse_html`, or `WebFetch`) now carry explicit untrusted-content
  guidance: treat fetched content as untrusted data, never as instructions to
  follow. `seo-flow` already had this; the other 13 agents were missing it.
  Fixes #291.

### Added

- `content_humanize.py` now strips invisible Unicode watermark characters (zero-width
  codepoints, directional marks/overrides, tag characters) and normalizes exotic spaces
  before the AI-phrasing pass, which those codepoints otherwise defeat by breaking `\b`
  word boundaries. Emoji sequences (ZWJ, variation selectors) are preserved. The
  `seo-content` skill documents the new triggers and the scope limits (statistical
  watermarks are untouched; intended for the user's own drafts).
- Templated-metadata detector (`scripts/metadata_template.py`): flags meta descriptions that
  restate their own title tag verbatim and then close with a stock call to action, the shape bulk
  metadata jobs produce site-wide. Deterministic string comparison, no model, `method: heuristic`
  in its output. Exposes a site-level roll-up (`templated_ratio`, `shared_cta_phrases`, `site_risk`)
  because duplicated/templated metadata is a site-scale signal, not a per-page one. Wired into
  `seo-page`, the `seo-content` agent, the quality-gates meta description table, and the
  `seo-programmatic` uniqueness gate, which measures body copy only and therefore cannot see this.
- `fetch_page.py --json` exposes full response metadata and content for raw and
  rendered fetches, including structured fetch errors (#282).
- `fetch_page.py --json --max-text N` truncates content fields, matching
  `render_page.py`'s option.

### Changed

- Google Search guidance refreshed through 2026-09-10 from Google-owned sources:
  site reputation abuse enforcement now differs for EEA searchers (2026-08-28),
  region-specific aggregator and supplier units are documented for the EEA, South
  Africa, and Turkiye (2026-09-08), AI Mode adds travel booking and price tracking
  (2026-08-27), and the CrUX pass-rate figure moves to the August 2026 dataset.
- `safe_requests_get` and `safe_requests_head` send browser-like default headers
  instead of `User-Agent: python-requests/x.y.z`, which managed WAFs answer with
  403/406 and SSR frameworks answer with an empty client-side shell, both of
  which callers were analysing as if they were the real document. The values are
  `fetch_page.py`'s and now live in `url_safety` as the single source of truth,
  with `fetch_page.py` importing them back. `Accept-Language` is not sent unless
  the caller passes one: announcing `en-US` makes a multi-locale site serve its
  English variant, which corrupts hreflang and international audits. (#200)

### Fixed

- `uninstall.ps1` failed on Windows PowerShell 5.1 with "A positional parameter
  cannot be found" because it used the three-argument `Join-Path` form that only
  PowerShell 7 accepts; caught by the new 5.1 smoke job.
- `content_quality.py` tokenises CJK text so Korean, Japanese, and Chinese pages get a
  real score instead of collapsing to one token, and reports a `coverage` object
  (`entity_density: not_computed`, `phrase_lists: english_only`) plus a human note when
  the detected script means part of the composite was not computed, so a CJK score is
  not presented as comparable to an English one (#263).
- Every live fetch failed behind a configured HTTP proxy: the pinned resolver
  refused to resolve the proxy's own address, so nothing left the process. The
  proxy host `requests` selects for the URL is now exempt from that check, and
  only that host. (#280)
- The JSON-LD hook now validates every `application/ld+json` block regardless of
  attribute order, CSP `nonce`, `id` or `data-*` attributes, tag case, or an
  unquoted type value; such blocks were previously skipped without validation.
- The JSON-LD hook no longer reports runtime template expressions (JSX, Vue,
  Svelte, template literals in component files; PHP and EJS everywhere) as
  invalid JSON, while a malformed literal in plain HTML is still reported.
- The JSON-LD hook accepts the schema.org `@context` with a trailing slash, in
  list form, and in `{"@vocab": ...}` object form.
- `google_report.py` no longer labels a plain-string finding as "Info" in the
  executive summary's critical-issues box or in the full-audit category
  findings; the "Info" prefix/badge now appears only when the finding is a
  dict that carries an explicit `severity`.
- `parse_html.py` now detects `rel="canonical"` and `rel="alternate"`
  (hreflang) `<link>` tags case-insensitively, so `rel="Alternate"` or
  `REL="Canonical"` are no longer silently dropped. Credit to #269 for the
  report that prompted this investigation.
- AI crawler claims are now checked against the crawler that actually governs them.
  `GPTBot` was documented as "ChatGPT web search" in the `seo-geo` crawler table; it is
  OpenAI's model-training crawler, while `OAI-SearchBot` is what determines ChatGPT
  Search citability. `Google-Extended` governs Gemini/Vertex training and grounding only
  and is no longer treated as a Google Search readiness signal (Google Search, AI
  Overviews, and AI Mode all follow `Googlebot`). The same GPTBot-shaped conflation was
  found for Claude: `ClaudeBot` (Anthropic's training crawler) was listed as a
  search-visibility crawler in `seo-geo`'s table, agent, and recommendation line, while
  `Claude-SearchBot` (the crawler that actually governs Claude search citability) was
  missing entirely. `seo-technical` already had `ClaudeBot` correctly labelled
  training-only, so `seo-geo` and the `seo-geo` agent were brought into agreement with
  it rather than the other way around. Adds `Claude-SearchBot` and `Applebot-Extended`
  (Apple's training-opt-out token, distinct from `Applebot` search indexing) to both
  skills, a claim-to-bot mapping table for all four vendors, citations to each vendor's
  own crawler documentation (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Apple), the missing
  `OAI-SearchBot` row to the `seo-technical` crawler table, and requires training access
  and search citability to be reported as separate findings. The `anthropic-ai` row is
  marked unverified: it does not appear on Anthropic's current crawler support article.
- `fetch_page.py --json` emitted a different key set for the raw path than the
  rendered path (raw dumped `fetch_page()`'s own dict as-is; rendered dumped
  `render_page()`'s dict as-is). Both paths now go through
  `render_page._json_summary` after the raw result is mapped onto the
  render_page contract, so `--json` output has one shared shape and `--max-text`
  applies to both (#297).
- `install.ps1` crashed on Windows PowerShell 5.1 before it could even check
  whether Python was installed: `Test-PythonCandidate`'s `-Args` parameter was
  a mandatory `[string[]]`, which 5.1 rejects when called with an empty array,
  and `Resolve-Python` calls it that way for the `python3`/`python` candidates
  (#207).
- The Windows installer smoke workflow only ran the install/verify/uninstall
  sequence under PowerShell Core (`pwsh`); a parallel job now runs the same
  steps under Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`shell: powershell`), which is what
  actually caught #207.
- The dataforseo, firecrawl, ahrefs, and banana extension installers wrote
  their MCP server block to `~/.claude/settings.json`, a key Claude Code does
  not read from that file, so the server never loaded and reinstalling could
  not fix it. They now write `~/.claude.json` (the file `claude mcp add`
  writes) across install/uninstall scripts, banana's Python helpers, and the
  setup docs. `bing-webmaster`, `profound`, and `seranking` were left alone:
  they write the `env` key, which settings.json does support (#204).
- `extensions/firecrawl/install.ps1` and `extensions/banana/scripts/
  setup_mcp.py` now write `~/.claude.json` atomically (temp file in the same
  directory, then `Move-Item -Force` / `os.replace`), and the PowerShell
  serialisation depth is raised from 10 to 100 so an existing `~/.claude.json`
  with deeply nested config round-trips intact instead of being flattened.
- `scripts/backlinks_auth.py`'s token file hardening was a no-op on Windows:
  it had no write path at all, and its permission story on POSIX (none) did
  not match `google_auth.py`'s OAuth token handling. It now shares
  `google_auth._chmod_quiet`, gains a `save_config()` that mirrors
  `google_auth.py`'s `os.open`/`os.fchmod` 0o600 write pattern, and both
  `save_config()` and `load_config()` make a best-effort `icacls` call on
  Windows to restrict `~/.config/claude-seo/backlinks-api.json` to the
  current user, since POSIX mode bits do not restrict NTFS ACLs (#290).
- 17 scripts raise `sys.exit(1)` at import time when an optional dependency
  (`requests`, `bs4`, `playwright`, `googleapiclient`, `google.analytics`) is
  missing. Any test module that imports one of these at module scope aborted
  the whole pytest session on a minimal install instead of skipping. 8 of the
  17 (`bing_webmaster`, `commoncrawl_graph`, `crux_history`, `fetch_page`,
  `moz_api`, `nlp_analyze`, `pagespeed_check`, `parse_html`) had test modules
  that needed the guard (`gsc_query`'s 3 test modules already had it; the
  other 8 of the 17 have no test module that imports them at module scope,
  so nothing to guard). `url_safety.py` itself hard-requires `requests`
  (by design), so every script that imports it transitively hits the same
  failure; guarded those test modules too (`domain_history`,
  `gbp_deprecation_lint`, `parasite_risk`, `agent_ux_check`/`render_page`,
  `indexnow_submit`, `url_safety`'s own suite, and the new
  `backlinks_auth` hardening tests). 17 test modules gained a
  `pytest.importorskip` guard in total. Verified in a throwaway venv with
  only `pytest` and `beautifulsoup4` installed: the suite completes (206
  passed, 24 skipped, no errors).
- `unlighthouse_run.py` no longer passes `--max-routes` as `--scanner
  '{"maxRoutes": N}'`, a CLI flag unlighthouse-ci's parser never reads (the
  crawl silently ran uncapped). Route count and a new per-page timeout are
  now set via a generated `unlighthouse.config.mjs` passed with
  `--config-file`, confirmed against unlighthouse's CLI source and docs.
  `ci-result.json` is parsed as the array the default `jsonSimple` reporter
  actually writes, with a tolerant fallback for the `jsonExpanded` object
  shape, instead of assuming a dict. `extensions/unlighthouse/install.sh`
  no longer aborts on a marketplace/plugin install: it now also checks
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and the plugin cache before requiring the manual
  `~/.claude/skills/seo` layout. Fixes #189.
- Raised `maxTurns` on all 16 agents `seo-audit` can spawn (`seo-technical`
  20→45, `seo-content` 15→45, and thirteen others that were below 30) so a
  large-site audit doesn't hit its turn budget before finishing. Every one of
  those agents now writes a partial findings file after its first analysis
  pass and overwrites it with the complete findings at the end, so a
  turn-budget stop never throws away completed work; `seo-audit`'s
  error-handling table documents the same contract for the orchestrator.
  Fixes #177, #272.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-09-10

### Security

- `commoncrawl_graph.py` no longer writes outside its cache directory: the `--release`
  value was interpolated raw into the cache filename, so `--release ../../../../tmp/x`
  escaped the cache directory and `_save_cache` wrote there. Malformed releases are now
  rejected at the CLI and path containment is asserted.
- `domain_history.py` no longer follows an unvalidated WHOIS referral. The IANA
  `refer:` host is resolved and validated through `url_safety` and dialled at the
  pinned address; an unusable referral degrades to IANA's own answer.
- `url_safety.is_safe_ip` now refuses the RFC 6598 shared address space
  (100.64.0.0/10), where Alibaba Cloud serves instance metadata, and judges
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals by their embedded address. This also refuses Tailscale
  addresses; see SECURITY.md.
- WeasyPrint floor raised to 70.0 (PYSEC-2026-3940) and requests to 2.34.2
  (CVE-2026-25645). `pip-audit` passes.
- SECURITY.md describes only reporting channels that exist: private vulnerability
  reporting is enabled and the unreachable email fallback is gone.

### Added

- The plugin installs from the claude.ai-hosted marketplace. Hosted sync rejects any
  plugin with a top-level `bin/` directory, so the launcher moved to
  `scripts/claude-seo` and every skill, agent, and doc calls it as
  `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-seo" run <script.py>`. Manual installs copy the
  launcher to `~/.claude/skills/seo/scripts/claude-seo` and rewrite that token to the
  absolute path. A layout test keeps `bin/` from coming back. Fixes #298 and #199.
- CI runs the full suite on Windows and macOS, audits `requirements.txt` with
  `pip-audit`, and no longer swallows a failed dependency install in the v2 audit.
- `CLAUDE_SEO_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the config and ledger location, so the ledger tests
  run against an isolated file. `BANANA_HOME` does the same for the Banana ledger.
- `preload_check.py --fail-under N` turns the score into an opt-in gate.
- Regression coverage for the backlink report validator, the schema-hook UTF-8 output,
  CRLF checkouts, PSI null category scores, ledger concurrency, the hosted plugin layout,
  and every ledger kind accepted by `seo_updates.py`.

### Changed

- Dependency floors raised by Dependabot: google-auth 2.56.2, courlan 1.4.0,
  playwright 1.62.0, numpy 2.2.6 (a major bump from 1.26; matplotlib moves to 3.9.0,
  the first line that supports numpy 2).
- `seo-technical` treats dynamic rendering as a workaround to flag, not a target state,
  and recommends SSR, SSG, or CSR with a preferred-framework list.
- The `seo-backlinks` skill and `free-backlink-sources.md` no longer contradict each
  other on Common-Crawl-only reports: no numeric score is produced, and
  `validate_backlink_report.py` fails a report that carries one.
- The Repository Topology section of CLAUDE.md describes the two single-remote
  checkouts and the cherry-pick promotion flow actually in use.
- The three `test_sync_flow.py` tests that call the live GitHub API run only when
  `CLAUDE_SEO_NETWORK_TESTS=1`; both CI test jobs set it with `GH_TOKEN`.

### Fixed

- The DataForSEO and Banana cost ledgers lost concurrent writes and could reset spend
  history after a truncated write. One exclusive lock now spans each read-modify-write,
  writes are atomic, Windows falls back to `msvcrt`, and a corrupt ledger fails closed.
- `pagespeed_check.py` raised `TypeError` when a Lighthouse category returned a null
  score; the category is now skipped and the page is kept.
- `preload_check.py` exited 1 on every successful run that scored below 75. A completed
  analysis exits 0. (#281)
- `consistency_check.py` reported every FLOW-locked prompt as a hash mismatch on CRLF
  checkouts; it folds CRLF before hashing.
- `seo_updates.py --kind documentation` was rejected by argparse while the ledger used
  that kind; the CLI and the schema now share one list.
- Optional Google, Bing, and rendering dependencies missing at import time no longer
  abort the whole pytest session (`pytest.importorskip` in the affected modules).
- The schema-hook tests decode the hook's UTF-8 output explicitly instead of through the
  locale codec, which is cp1252 on Windows.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Focused regression coverage for manual-install data packaging, runtime imports,
  JSON-LD graph validation, empty rendered pages, accessibility-tree capture,
  JSON output bounds, and managed-runtime command references.
- Strict Google update-ledger validation for chronological order, known event
  kinds, exact approved hostnames, unique names, and verification dates.

### Changed

- Refreshed Google Search guidance through 2026-08-25 using Google-owned sources,
  including the August spam update, Preferred Sources, Search Console platform
  properties, review transparency, merchant schema, canonical timing, and AMP.
- Updated Lighthouse guidance to 13.4.1, including PSI API support for Agentic
  Browsing and the Node.js 22.19 minimum for the CLI.
- JSON render output now preserves full content by default and supports explicit,
  measured text bounds through `--max-text`.

### Fixed

- Manual installs now include the update ledger, and runtime setup validates the
  split `lxml_html_clean` dependency required by current lxml releases.
- JSON-LD hooks now traverse top-level graphs, reject malformed graph members,
  handle non-UTF-8 input safely, and avoid ordinary-language placeholder false
  positives.
- Agent-UX reports now fail closed on empty rendered documents, capture Chromium's
  accessibility tree through CDP, and expose partial or failed capture states.
- User-facing guidance now routes bundled Python modules through `claude-seo run`.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-07-20

Community maintenance release following a full review of every open issue and pull request.
Accepted findings were reconciled against the current release base, with superseded or unsafe
patches excluded. No breaking command changes. Full suite: 410 passing tests.

### Added

- Managed cross-platform Python runtime with `claude-seo run`, `/seo setup`, and `/seo doctor`.
  Plugin environments persist under Claude's plugin data directory, manual installs use an
  isolated local environment, and bundled scripts no longer depend on the caller's working
  directory or a hardcoded Python executable.
- SSRF-safe sitemap discovery covering robots.txt directives, common CMS locations, stale
  fallbacks, bounded responses, and strict cross-host validation.
- Contributor and issue-reporter acknowledgements for the complete maintenance review cycle.

### Fixed

- GSC queries now honor exact result limits, validate dimensions before API access, support
  dimensionless totals, and report whether aggregate totals are complete.
- Bing Webmaster backlink commands now use supported endpoints, bounded pagination, deduplication,
  registered-property comparison, partial-failure reporting, and sanitized errors.
- DataForSEO agents now expose only the required MCP tool family and fail closed when it is absent.
- Banana extension paths now work in plugin and manual layouts.
- OAuth token persistence is safe on Windows, hook and child-process output is UTF-8, and report
  input handling is explicitly UTF-8.
- SPA rendering recognizes common hosted builders, uses bounded DOM stabilization, and extracts
  JSON-LD before HTML truncation without leaking malformed fragments in routine output.
- Removed unsupported FAQPage rich-result benefit claims and templates after Google's retirement
  of FAQ rich results.
- GitHub Actions checkout and Python setup actions moved to v7. Anonymous FLOW synchronization now
  retries rate-limited requests through the authenticated path when available.

### Security

- Runtime dispatch is allowlisted, setup upgrades are rollback-safe, diagnostics redact paths and
  identity-like values, and structured-data output is bounded.
- Removed the maintainer email address from public package and citation metadata.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-07-14

Prompt-hygiene alignment to the Fable 5 prompt principles. No behavior, routing, or output changes.

- Removed CAPS emphasis words (MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS, and a CRITICAL RULES heading) used as emphasis
  across skills and agents; severity status tokens left intact.
- Swept em-dashes and en-dashes from prose to commas, colons, and hyphens across the prompt surface
  (code fences untouched).
- Trimmed five over-long skill descriptions.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-07-10

Full-review maintenance pass (2026-07-09/10). 319 adversarially verified findings from a
multi-engine review (7 Google research streams, 20 currency audit slices, 6 refuter slices);
all fix bundles applied. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- GBP Q&A false-deprecation removed from `scripts/gbp_deprecation_lint.py` and
  `skills/seo/references/local-seo-signals.md` (Google: Q&A is category/region-limited, not retired).
- AI Mode model claim corrected to Google's confirmed "custom version of Gemini 2.5";
  AI Overviews / AI Mode user counts attributed to third-party I/O 2026 reporting.
- Stale Gemini image-model IDs refreshed across seo-image-gen and the banana extension;
  dead `scripts/presets.py` / `cost_tracker.py` invocations repointed.
- rel=next/prev pagination and Publisher Center news-sitemap guidance corrected; WebMCP audit
  IDs aligned with Lighthouse 13.2.0 release notes; GA4 AI Assistants source list fixed.
- CLAUDE.md tree/table brought to v2.2.1; PRIVACY.md now discloses the Bing Webmaster /
  IndexNow extension; README offline phrasing corrected; TROUBLESHOOTING de-v1'd.
- `hooks/validate-schema.py` now supports the documented stdin hook-event contract.

### Added

- `scripts/consistency_check.py`: path-aware reference-graph gate (dead refs, routing tables,
  FLOW lock, orphans) with CI coverage via `tests/test_consistency_check.py`.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-06-22

Google-currency refresh. Reconfirms the suite against the latest Google updates, verified against Google-primary sources via a multi-agent reconfirmation run. Documentation/data accuracy only — no code behavior change beyond two added IPTC vocabulary values. No breaking changes.

### Fixed (stale → current)

- **Lighthouse**: `13.0 (Oct 2025)` → `13.4.0 (June 2026, latest stable)`; corrected the 13.0 description (insight-based audits, not "reorganized scoring weights"); documented the new **Agentic Browsing** category (created 13.2.0, default 13.3.0, disabled in the PSI REST API in 13.4.0) as a **fractional pass-ratio**, not a 0–100 score. (`agents/seo-performance.md`, `skills/seo/references/cwv-thresholds.md`, `skills/seo-technical/**`)
- **WebMCP**: replaced the "early preview / not before 2027" framing with the live **Chrome 149 origin trial** (sign-up open 2026-06-09) and the three shipped Lighthouse audits (`registered-webmcp-tools`, `forms-missing-declarative-webmcp`, `webmcp-schema-validity`).
- **GEO**: AI Overviews reach `1.5B` → **2.5B+ MAU** (I/O 2026); added that **Google Search ignores llms.txt** (docs, 2026-06-15); reconciled the unified AI-Search experience with the two-citation-engines model.
- **E-commerce**: UCP `"version": "1.0"` → **date-based** (current `2026-04-08`) with canonical URLs; **AP2 donated to FIDO** (2026-04-28); Universal Cart / Native-vs-Embedded checkout / Lodging+Food verticals.
- **Content/E-E-A-T**: removed the fabricated "December 2025 watershed / 71-67-52% drops" claim; set the plugin's internal E-E-A-T scorecard weights to **20/25/25/30** (Trust highest) — an internal scoring model; Google publishes no numeric E-E-A-T weights, only that 'trust is most important'.
- **Schema**: Dataset is **not discontinued** (Dataset Search still consumes it); corrected the deprecated-types tooling-removal timeline.
- **Technical**: softened mobile-first absolutism + added content-parity; added the **back-button hijacking** spam policy; page-experience framing; Googlebot **2MB/64MB** fetch limits; crawling-docs migration to developers.google.com/crawling; user-triggered fetchers (Google-Agent etc.) ignore robots.txt.
- **Verticals**: JPEG XL shipped (Chrome 145, flag-gated); two new IPTC DigitalSourceType values; hreflang ISO-15924 script subtags + signal hierarchy; sitemap 50MB/extension-subtype rules; **Apple Business** rename; Ask Maps / AI local pack.
- **Ledger**: refreshed `data/google-updates.json` (Feb 2026 Discover, March 2026 spam, May 2026 core completion, back-button policy, GSC gen-AI report, etc.); fixed the INP date and replaced 301'd `ranking-update-history` URLs with the Search Status Dashboard.

### Added

- `seo-google`: Search Console **Generative AI performance report**, GSC impressions logging-error caveat (2025-05-13 → 2026-04-27), GA4 **AI Assistants** channel.
- `scripts/iptc_ai_label.py`: `algorithmicMedia` and `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia` DigitalSourceType values.
- Documentation: primary-source reconfirmation details folded into public references.

### Fixed (command audit)

Full audit of every `/seo` command + subcommand (25 skills + 8 extensions), via deterministic wiring checks + 5 Codex sub-agents; findings were folded into this release.

- **Wiring bugs:** `seo-sxo` agent called `parse_html.py "<url>"` (script needs `--url`); `seo-sxo` and `seo-local` referenced DataForSEO tools not in the catalog (`google_organic_serp`/`keyword_data`/`local_business_data`/`google_local_pack_serp`/`business_listings` → `serp_organic_live_advanced` / `kw_data_google_ads_search_volume` / `business_data_business_listings_search`); `content-brief` used `serp_google_organic_live_advanced` → `serp_organic_live_advanced`; Bing `submit-batch`/`verify-indexnow` were missing the required `--host` flag.
- **Broken docs:** `docs/COMMANDS.md` google examples used non-existent command names (`psi`/`gsc-queries`/`indexing-notify`/`ga4-organic`/`check`) → real `pagespeed`/`gsc`/`inspect`/`index`/`ga4`; maps used `geogrid`/`audit` → `grid`/`gbp`; "7 specialist subagents" → "up to 15".
- **Shared-reference paths:** `seo-schema`/`seo-backlinks` pointed at `` `references/...` `` as if local → repointed to the shared `seo/references/` location.
- **COMMANDS.md completeness:** documented every previously-unlisted subcommand (backlinks, ecommerce, dataforseo cost/serp-images, flow, cluster, sxo, hreflang, images) and added the missing extension command tables (ahrefs, bing, profound, seranking, unlighthouse). Coverage now 100% (every skill subcommand is indexed).

### Fixed (docs consistency)

Reconciled the public docs/manifests with the v2.1.0–v2.2.1 code state via a parallel per-file pass with an independent verifier gate. No behavior change.

- **README.md:** added a "Since v2.0.0" recap (v2.1.0–v2.2.1); reframed the command surface to **30 user-invocable `/seo` commands** and added the five missing extension commands (`ahrefs`, `seranking`, `profound`, `bing`, `unlighthouse`) to the table; corrected stale figures: DataForSEO `22 → 23` commands, manifest `14 → 15` assertions, audit fan-out "6 parallel" → "up to 15 core audit agents; optional extension agents such as seo-dataforseo may run in addition", and the v2 test narrative to `39 → 326` (url_safety suite = 91 cases); reworded the "zero-network" overclaim (audits still fetch target URLs) and the Playwright optional/auto-install wording.
- **docs/COMMANDS.md:** added the five extension commands to the Quick Reference table (detail sections already existed).
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:** extension tree and capability table now cover all **8** extensions (added Ahrefs, SE Ranking, Profound, Bing Webmaster, Unlighthouse).
- **PRIVACY.md:** data-transfer disclosure for the five newer extensions (Unlighthouse marked local-only — no third-party egress); same zero-network reword.
- **SECURITY.md:** reconciled the internal `tests/test_url_safety.py` count contradiction (`52+` vs `122`) to the verified **91 cases (31 functions)** in both places.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** corrected the SSRF guidance — fetchers route through `scripts/url_safety.py` (`validate_url()` / `safe_requests_session()`), not `google_auth.py` (OAuth-only).
- **AGENTS.md:** removed the non-existent "ASO" extension (listed the real 8); added `seo-content-brief` and `seo-flow` to the tree and command table.
- **Other docs:** `MIGRATION-v1-to-v2.md` ("Three" → six rich-result types + v2.1–2.2.1 forward pointer), `MCP-INTEGRATION.md` (DataForSEO `22 → 23`), `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (schema false-positive note now covers the 2025 retirements + the 2026-05-07 FAQ retirement), `INSTALLATION.md` (Playwright wording), `WORKFLOW-public-private.md` (state section refreshed to v2.2.1 / 2026-06-22).
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:** descriptions refreshed for the 2.1–2.2.1 currency + command audit, and both trimmed under the 500-char registry cap (the plugin-entry description was previously over cap at 573).
- **`extensions/dataforseo/`:** `README.md`, `install.sh`, and `install.ps1` corrected `22 → 23` commands.

### Fixed (fact accuracy)

Corrections from a live re-confirmation of every time-sensitive Google claim against Google-primary sources fetched 2026-06-22. Confirmed claims were updated and uncertain claims relabeled. All are precision/labeling fixes — the v2.2.1 currency substance was confirmed accurate.

- **E-E-A-T weights are an internal model, not Google's.** Google publishes no numeric E-E-A-T weights (only "trust is most important"). Relabeled the 20/25/25/30 split as the plugin's own scoring model in `agents/seo-content.md`, `skills/seo-content/SKILL.md`, README, and this changelog.
- **FID was never in Lighthouse.** Removed "Lighthouse" from the FID-removal tool list across 7 files (it is a lab tool and never reported the field-only FID metric); the removal applies to Chrome's field-data tools (CrUX API, PageSpeed Insights).
- **QAPage is not the "FAQ replacement."** Reworded README + the v2.1.0 changelog note: QAPage is the type for genuine Q&A pages, not a replacement for FAQ rich results (per the primary `qapage` doc).
- **June 2025 deprecation date** corrected `2025-06-19 → 2025-06-12` (announcement date) in `data/google-updates.json` and the deprecated-types reference.
- **January-2026 tooling sunset scoped to Practice Problems** (the only type Google documents it for) in the deprecated-types reference, instead of generalizing it to all retired types.
- **Dead citation repaired:** the HowTo retirement source `…/2023/09/structured-data-changes` (HTTP 404) repointed to the real post `…/2023/08/howto-faq-changes`.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-12

Security, cross-platform, and data-accuracy release. Folds the v2.1.0 currency content into the first public ship and closes the full open-issue and PR backlog. No breaking changes.

### Security

- **Installer credential injection (blocker).** The DataForSEO, Firecrawl, and Banana installers interpolated user-supplied credentials into a `python3 -c` source string, allowing arbitrary code execution at install time when a credential contained `'''`. Credentials now pass as `argv` through a quoted heredoc, and the settings file is written atomically with `0600` permissions (shell installers plus the DataForSEO PowerShell installer). Found by an independent audit.
- **SSRF parser-differential bypass.** `url_safety.validate_url` accepted authority-confusion URLs such as `https://127.0.0.1:6666\@1.1.1.1`, which `requests` connects to the internal host. The validator now rejects backslash and userinfo authority confusion, covering every caller. Reported by @Fushuling (#110).
- **Google API key leak.** `pagespeed_check`, `crux_history`, `nlp_analyze`, and `lcp_subparts` put the API key in the request URL and echoed it on error. Keys now travel in the `X-Goog-Api-Key` header with redacted error output. Reported by @webgunnz (#122); header approach from #104 (@fayerman-source).
- **Post-audit hardening pass.** Extended the credential-injection fix to the extension uninstallers and the Banana config probe (argv through quoted heredocs). Added Bing Webmaster API key redaction on transport errors. Switched the DataForSEO and Firecrawl PowerShell installers from `PtrToStringAuto` to `PtrToStringBSTR` so SecureString credentials decode correctly under PowerShell on Linux and macOS.
- **Secret-scan CI gate.** A new job in `ci.yml` and `v2.yml` fails the build when any tracked file contains a high-signal credential pattern (Google, GitHub, AWS, Google OAuth, OpenAI, Slack); test fixtures and documented placeholders are allowlisted. `.gitignore` extended to cover more credential and key formats. Verified against the full history and tracked tree: no real secret present.

### Fixed

- **GSC false "0 clicks" totals (#130).** Site totals were summed from per-query rows, which GSC anonymizes for low-volume queries. Totals now come from a dimensionless aggregate query. Reported by @fayerman-source.
- **Windows drift_baseline portability (#114, #124).** Removed `/dev/stdout`, use a tempfile fetch-to-parse handoff with `errors="replace"`, and handle the Microsoft Store Python alias (PRs #117, #128, #111, #115, #125).
- **Cross-platform PostToolUse hook (#102, #112, #120).** The JSON-LD validator runs through a Node launcher that resolves `python3`/`py`, fixing failures on macOS and Linux without a bare `python` (PR #101).
- **fetch_page UTF-8 double-encode (#121).** Honor the Content-Type and `<meta>` charset deterministically when the server omits a charset.
- **GSC deprecated `indexed` field (#113).** No longer surfaced (it always returned 0).
- **NLP entity metadata (#103).** Use the V1 `analyzeEntities` endpoint so Knowledge Graph `mid`/`wikipedia_url` and salience are returned.
- **Moz free-tier auth (#100).** Use the Links API REST endpoint with HTTP Basic auth.
- **FAQ schema hook.** FAQPage is no longer flagged (FAQ rich results were retired in May 2026, but the markup still aids AI Mode); deprecated and retired types still block.
- **Broken sub-skill reference paths.** `/seo local` and `/seo maps` instructed the model to load `references/*.md` from directories that do not exist; both now point to the shared `skills/seo/references/` files they always intended.
- **seo-cluster template now ships.** `templates/cluster-map.html` was excluded by an over-broad `.gitignore` rule, so installed users never received the interactive cluster visualization. It is now tracked.
- **Unlighthouse and Ahrefs extension invocations.** The Unlighthouse extension called a non-existent npm package (`unlighthouse-cli`); it now uses `unlighthouse@0.13.5`. The Ahrefs extension is pinned to `@ahrefs/mcp@0.0.11` and invokes the package's real `mcp` binary.
- **FLOW prompt dead links.** 82 links across the 41 FLOW prompt files pointed at the upstream folder layout that does not exist in this plugin. `sync_flow.py` now rewrites them to the flattened layout on every sync, and the existing files were repaired.
- **sync_flow offline crash.** `--dry-run` raised an uncaught network error when GitHub was unreachable; it now exits cleanly with an actionable message.
- **Install slug and stale figures.** Corrected the marketplace slug in the install docs to `claude-seo@agricidaniel-claude-seo`, the `CITATION.cff` release date, the README test count (326), the AGENTS.md script count (50), and the README FAQ guidance.

### Added

- Full-audit report persistence and audit-aware report builders (#51, #61).
- ruff configuration (#123) and `pyproject.toml` authors and keywords (#118).
- Regression tests for installer injection, GSC totals, and the schema hook policy.

### Changed

- Plugin description trimmed under the 500-character registry cap (#99).
- Docs normalized from bare `python` to `python3`; CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md script inventory corrected to 50; README test count updated.
- Corrected the inert `user-invokable` frontmatter key to `user-invocable`.
- Pinned the Ahrefs, Unlighthouse, and DataForSEO npm packages to exact versions across installers and prewarm steps.
- Documented the `/seo content-brief` command in the command reference and README, added `/seo flow` to the project command table, and reconciled the command count to the 25 the orchestrator routes.

### Housekeeping

- Removed the duplicate root `CODEOWNERS`; CI compiles every `scripts/*.py` dynamically; marketplace extension count corrected from 7 to 8; dependency floor bumps (Dependabot #105 to #109, #116).
- Removed the orphaned `branding/` preview tooling (it referenced deleted diagram assets) and the inactive npm Dependabot watcher (the repo ships no npm manifest). Hardened the Python hook probe against environment-specific `EPERM`, gave Banana `validate_setup.py --help` proper argument handling, and repaired stale internal documentation links. Full suite at 326 passing.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-25

Knowledge-currency refresh for Google's May 2026 wave: the **May 2026 core update**, **Google I/O 2026** (Gemini 3.5 Flash now powers AI Mode globally; AI Mode past 1B monthly users), and the **May 7 2026 retirement of FAQ rich results**. No architecture, API, or command changes — every v2.0.0 entry point still works.

### Added

- **`data/google-updates.json`:** four primary-source-verified entries — March 2026 Core Update (promoted from `unverified[]` after Google status-dashboard confirmation; Mar 27 to Apr 8 rollout), FAQ rich result retirement (May 7), Google I/O 2026 / Gemini 3.5 Flash in AI Mode (May 19), and the May 2026 Core Update (May 21). `unverified[]` is now empty; `last_verified` bumped to 2026-05-25.
- **`skills/seo-geo/SKILL.md`:** AI Mode is now modeled as a **distinct citation engine** from AI Overviews (Ahrefs: only 13.7% URL overlap across 540K query pairs), with its own row in the platform table, the Gemini 3.5 Flash + 1B-user stats, content **recency** as a citation lever (~3x for content under 3 months, SE Ranking), and the "~44% of AI citations come from the first 30% of the page" finding.
- **`skills/seo/references/schema-types.md`:** `QAPage` added as the active type for genuine user Q&A (the active type for real Q&A pages — not a replacement for FAQ rich results).
- **`tests/test_schema_v2.py`:** `test_faq_rich_results_retirement_documented` locks the May 7 2026 FAQ retirement + QAPage-for-Q&A guidance across the canonical schema references.

### Changed

- **FAQ schema guidance** corrected across the canonical sources (`schema-types.md`, `deprecated-types-2024-2026.md`, `seo-schema/SKILL.md`, `agents/seo-schema.md`, `seo/SKILL.md`, `seo-page/SKILL.md`, `seo-content/SKILL.md`, `seo-plan/assets/saas.md`): FAQ rich results are **fully retired for all sites as of May 7, 2026**, superseding the Aug 2023 gov/health framing. FAQPage stays Info-priority as an AI/entity signal (never a Critical removal); `QAPage` is the type for genuine Q&A pages.
- **`skills/seo-content/SKILL.md`:** AI Mode description updated to the Gemini 3.5 Flash / 1B-user / two-citation-engine reality.
- Version bumped to `2.1.0` across `plugin.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `CITATION.cff`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, and 32 SKILL.md files (`seo-content-brief` stays at 1.0.0 per COMMUNITY_OVERRIDES). Gated by `tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-17

v2 is backward-compatible by design — every v1.x command, script signature, and skill entry point still works. The release lands a hardened SSRF + DNS-rebinding safety layer, shared headless rendering across every fetcher, QRG-aligned content gates, four new Schema.org generators, five new MCP extensions, and multi-platform portability. Full narrative in [`docs/MIGRATION-v1-to-v2.md`](docs/MIGRATION-v1-to-v2.md).

### Highlights

- 248 tests (6.4× the v1.9.9 baseline of 39), every known SSRF bypass class closed at parse time.
- 5 new MCP extensions: Ahrefs, SE Ranking, Profound, Bing Webmaster, Unlighthouse.
- 4 new Schema.org generators: Reservation, OrderAction (potentialAction), DiscussionForumPosting, ProfilePage.
- Multi-platform portability for Codex CLI, Cline, Aider (alongside existing Cursor + Antigravity).

### Added

- **Foundation:** `scripts/url_safety.py` (canonical SSRF + DNS-rebinding module, 83 test cases), `scripts/render_page.py` (shared Playwright Chromium renderer with `--mode auto` SPA detection, trafilatura extraction, htmldate publication-date extraction, 27 test cases). 8 fetcher subagents (seo-technical, seo-content, seo-schema, seo-geo, seo-local, seo-ecommerce, seo-backlinks, seo-sxo) now route through `render_page`.
- **Content quality:** `content_quality.py` (QRG filler / AI-pattern / information-density scorer), `content_humanize.py` (40+ deterministic AI-phrasing replacements), `content_verify.py` (claim extraction + citation-gap detection), `domain_history.py` (WHOIS-driven expired-domain abuse check), `seo_updates.py` + `data/google-updates.json` (18 primary-source-verified Google updates, 1 documented-unverified gap-analysis claim).
- **Technical depth:** `preload_check.py` (Speculation Rules + bfcache + prerender + LCP preload audit), `indexnow_submit.py` (Bing/Yandex/Seznam/Naver IndexNow submitter), `lcp_subparts.py` (LCP decomposition via CrUX), `unlighthouse_run.py` (multi-page Lighthouse via Unlighthouse CLI).
- **Schema completeness:** `schema_generate.py` (`reservation`, `order`, `discussion`, `profile` subcommands), `schema_ecommerce_validate.py` (Product schema policy validator: `hasMerchantReturnPolicy`, `shippingDetails`, `MemberProgram`, EU `energyEfficiencyClass`, `ProductGroup`), reference doc `skills/seo-schema/references/deprecated-types-2024-2026.md`.
- **AI search:** `parasite_risk.py` (site-reputation-abuse risk scanner per Nov 2024 Google policy), `skills/seo-geo/references/llmstxt-evidence.md` (evidence-based reframe of llms.txt as dev-tooling, not citation lever).
- **Local + international + privacy:** `gbp_deprecation_lint.py` (retired GBP chat / `.business.site` / Q&A detector), `skills/seo-google/references/dma-consent-mode-v2.md` (EU CTR diagnostic + softened cookieless framing), `skills/seo-hreflang/references/machine-translation-qa.md` (untranslated-MT detection per Jan 2025 QRG §4.6.5).
- **Portability:** `portability_check.py` (cross-platform SKILL.md frontmatter lint), AGENTS.md tool-name compatibility table for Codex CLI, Cline, Aider.
- **Release signing:** `release_sign.py` (SHA-256 manifest of every git-tracked file), `verify_release.py` (verify a checkout against a signed manifest).
- **Governance:** `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/dependabot.yml` extended with npm ecosystem, `.github/workflows/v2.yml` (workflow_dispatch only), `SECURITY.md` uplift (threat model, 90-day coordinated disclosure timeline, residual risks).

### Changed

- `scripts/google_auth.py:validate_url` now delegates to `url_safety.validate_url`. Strict variant available as `url_safety.validate_url_strict`.
- `scripts/fetch_page.py` exposes `--render {auto,always,never}`. Default `auto` runs raw fetch then renders if SPA signals detected; `always` forces Playwright; `never` preserves v1 behaviour.
- `scripts/capture_screenshot.py` uses `url_safety.make_safe_playwright_route_handler` as defense-in-depth against subresource SSRF (data: allowed, private resolutions aborted, AF_UNSPEC IPv6-aware).
- OAuth token files are now written with `os.open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0o600)` + explicit `os.fchmod(fd, 0o600)`. Legacy `0o644` files are remediated in place on next `_load_oauth_token`.
- `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `CITATION.cff` / `install.sh` / `install.ps1` / 32 SKILL.md files: version bumped to `2.0.0`. The 13-assertion manifest test (`tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`) gates this.

### Fixed

- **HIGH — DNS rebinding via redirect target.** `_pin_dns` previously intercepted only the originally-pinned hostname; redirect targets fell through to the unpatched resolver. Patched `socket.getaddrinfo` now validates every resolution while pinned. Closed in `a601268`.
- **HIGH — Obfuscated IPv4 bypass in `validate_url`.** Decimal (`2130706433`), hex (`0x7f000001`), octal (`017700000001`), leading-zero (`127.0.0.001`, `0177.0.0.1`), and mixed-radix (`0x7f.0.0.1`) forms all returned safe. New `normalize_hostname()` canonicalizes via `socket.inet_aton`. Closed in `3c595c2`.
- **HIGH — FQDN trailing-dot bypass.** `metadata.google.internal.` (single trailing dot) bypassed the exact-string blocklist. `normalize_hostname` now strips a single trailing dot. Closed in `3c595c2`.
- **MEDIUM — IPv6 blind spot in Playwright route handler.** Resolver queried only `AF_INET`. Now uses `AF_UNSPEC` to catch dual-stack subresources whose AAAA record points at a private range. Closed in `3c595c2`.
- **LOW — OAuth file-permission TOCTOU.** `os.open`'s mode argument is ignored if the file pre-existed. Explicit `os.fchmod(fd, 0o600)` on the open fd closes the race. Closed in `3c595c2`.

### Breaking

Two intentional behavioural breaks; full mitigation guidance in `docs/MIGRATION-v1-to-v2.md`.

1. `scripts/backlinks_auth.py` no longer ships a silent SSRF-disabled fallback. If `url_safety` cannot be imported, the module raises `RuntimeError` at import time.
2. `seo-schema` flags six retired rich-result types as **Critical** findings (`Vehicle`, `ClaimReview`, `EstimatedSalary`, `LearningVideo`, `SpecialAnnouncement`, `CourseInfo` carousel). Replacements documented in `skills/seo-schema/references/deprecated-types-2024-2026.md`.

### Test coverage delta

| Suite | v1.9.9 | v2.0.0 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pre-existing (manifest + lazy + sync FLOW) | 39 | 39 |
| `url_safety` (new) | — | 83 |
| `render_page` (new) | — | 27 |
| Content quality (new) | — | 25 |
| Technical depth (new) | — | 17 |
| Schema v2 (new) | — | 17 |
| Parasite risk + extensions (new) | — | 22 |
| GBP lint + polish (new) | — | 8 |
| Portability (new) | — | 10 |
| **Total** | **39** | **248** |

## [1.9.9] - 2026-05-11

Final 1.x patch release. v2 is in design; this release leaves the v1.x
branch in a clean, well-documented, dependency-current state.

Independently verified across 5 rounds of GPT-5.5 xhigh code review via
the Codex CLI before each PR push. Issue #92 + issue #41 closed.

### Highlights
- Five top-level versions, 24 in-tree skills, 3 extension SKILL.md files,
  and both install scripts triangulate to `1.9.9` atomically. CI guard
  extended from 9 to 13 assertions covering the orchestrator SKILL.md,
  per-skill `metadata.version`, marketplace.json metadata.description + author
  parity, and Sub-Skills/Subagents list consistency with disk.
- Five Dependabot dependency floor bumps merged as one batched PR after
  isolated-venv smoke-testing of the full API surface we actually use.
- Image audit now correctly detects JS lazy-loaders (Perfmatters, EWWW,
  generic) rather than reporting "not lazy-loaded" on heavily-optimized
  WordPress sites.

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator drift in `skills/seo/SKILL.md`** (issue #92): line 9
  `metadata.version: "1.9.6"` was stale; descriptive headline at lines 19-21
  still claimed "21 specialized sub-skills"; Sub-Skills numbered list at
  176-199 included `seo-firecrawl` (which is an extension, not in `skills/`)
  and was missing `seo-content-brief` (the PR #56 contribution). Subagents
  bullet list had the same drift pattern (included `seo-firecrawl`, no agent
  file on disk; missing `seo-flow`, file exists). Reconciled. Numbered list
  now reaches 24 (the orchestrator itself is the 25th in `skills/` but does
  not orchestrate itself), `seo-firecrawl` moved to a new "Optional
  Extensions" subsection, Subagents list now matches `agents/seo-*.md` set
  exactly.
- **`marketplace.json` drift** (issue #92): `metadata.description` was
  missing the "sub-agents" count claim that `plugins[0].description` carried;
  plugin entry had no `author` object despite v1.9.8 release notes claiming
  one was added in commit `8514999` (verification showed it was not). Both
  fixed. v1.9.8 entry in this CHANGELOG corrected to reflect what actually
  shipped.
- **`AGENTS.md:109`** said "17 subagents"; disk has 18. Fixed.
- **`install.sh` and `install.ps1` default tag pinned to `v1.9.0`** across 4
  missed release bumps (v1.9.5/.6/.7/.8). Anyone running
  `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash` got the April 14 release, missing FLOW
  integration, the security audit pass, doc reconciliation, the manifest CI
  guard plus v1.9.8 Phase B bug fixes (Windows hook, OAuth refresh, missing
  imports, None guards). Bumped to `v1.9.9` atomically with this release.
- **`pyproject.toml`** had drifted to `1.9.6` while plugin.json + CITATION
  shipped at 1.9.8. Bumped to 1.9.9 with the release.
- **23 in-tree skill `metadata.version` fields** were stuck at `1.9.6`; 3
  extension SKILL.md files were at `1.9.0`/`1.7.2`. All bumped to `1.9.9`.
  `seo-content-brief` deliberately stays at `1.0.0` (community contribution,
  CI allowlist).
- **Image audit (issue #41)**: `scripts/parse_html.py` now classifies each
  image's lazy-loading mechanism in a `lazy_method` field with five values:
  `native | perfmatters | ewww | js-generic | none`. Sites running Perfmatters,
  EWWW Image Optimizer, lazysizes, vanilla-lazyload, or jQuery lazy-loaders
  are no longer mis-reported as "not lazy-loaded". `skills/seo-page/SKILL.md`
  and `skills/seo-images/SKILL.md` are updated to consume the new field.

### Added

- **CI guard extension (9 -> 13 assertions)** in
  `tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`:
  - `test_orchestrator_sub_skills_list_matches_disk`: Sub-Skills list must
    equal `set(skills/*) - {seo}`; no duplicates. Regex scoped to the
    `## Sub-Skills` section via a new `_extract_section()` helper.
  - `test_orchestrator_subagents_list_matches_disk`: Subagents bullet list
    must equal `set(agents/seo-*.md)`; no duplicates. Bullet-anchored regex.
  - `test_skill_metadata_versions_match_plugin_json`: every
    `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `extensions/*/skills/*/SKILL.md` `metadata.version`
    must equal `plugin.json` version, with `COMMUNITY_OVERRIDES` allowlist
    `{"seo-content-brief": "1.0.0"}`. Scoped to YAML frontmatter only via
    a new `_extract_frontmatter()` helper, so a fenced code example showing
    `version: "..."` cannot satisfy the check.
  - `test_marketplace_metadata_and_author_parity`: marketplace.json
    `metadata.description` includes both counts and they match plugin.json;
    plugin entry `author` parities plugin.json author for `name`, `email`,
    AND `url`.
- **`tests/test_lazy_detection.py`** (new): 11 unit tests covering all
  `_detect_lazy_method()` branches plus an integration check on `parse_html()`.
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): test job now installs
  `beautifulsoup4` alongside `pytest`, required by the new lazy-detection
  test that exercises real BeautifulSoup parsing.

### Changed

- **5 Python dependency floor bumps** (batched as a single PR after isolated-
  venv smoke testing — see [PR #94]):

  | Package | Floor before | Floor after | Source PR |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `playwright` | 1.56.0 | 1.59.0 | #80 |
  | `weasyprint` | 61.0 | 68.1 | #78 |
  | `openpyxl` | 3.1.0 | 3.1.5 | #76 |
  | `google-api-python-client` | 2.100.0 | 2.196.0 | #77 |
  | `google-auth-oauthlib` | 1.0.0 | 1.4.0 | #79 |

  All five upper bounds preserved. No CVE-driven escalations.

  **Caveat**: `google-auth-oauthlib` 1.4.0 drops Python 3.9 support. This
  repo's `pyproject.toml` requires Python `>=3.10` already, so no impact for
  the declared support matrix. External consumers still on 3.9 should pin
  `google-auth-oauthlib<1.4.0` themselves.

### Deferred to v2

The following items are out of scope for v1.9.9 to keep this a clean patch
release. v2 will be a separate design conversation:

- **#11** SPA / CSR audit support (7-phase implementation; PR #90 Limitations
  section remains the patch-appropriate response)
- **#51** Subagent research persistence (changes documented output contract
  across 15 agent files; v2 will define a persistence convention shared by
  `seo-audit`, `seo-drift`, `seo-cluster`)
- **#61** `google_report.py --type full` audit-schema handling (no regression
  baseline fixture corpus exists; v2 will ship one with the bug fix)
- **#89** uv adoption (issue itself labels v2.x candidate; preserves
  `requirements.txt` format as migration headroom)
- **#53** seo-notebooklm skill (depends on unofficial wrapper, 536 lines of
  unreviewed credential code; v2 will define an "experimental skills" tier)
- **PR #46** path resolution + macOS SSL: `pip-system-certs` is a new
  dependency that violates v1.9.9's no-new-deps non-goal. v2 will land the
  full macOS support story.

### Compatibility / migration

- No breaking changes. Patch release per SemVer.
- The orchestrator's Sub-Skills numbered list was renumbered (insertion of
  `seo-content-brief`, removal of `seo-firecrawl`). Any downstream consumer
  that referenced sub-skills by **index** rather than **name** would break;
  grep found no such consumer in this repo, but third-party docs that
  hard-coded "skill 21 is seo-firecrawl" would need updating.
- `/seo audit` still does NOT persist subagent research/findings between
  runs (this is the intentional v1.x contract; v2 will revisit per #51).

## [1.9.8] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Skill-count drift returned via PR #56.** When the `seo-content-brief` skill
  was merged into v1.9.7 it added a 21st core skill, but the manifest
  reconciliation in v1.9.7 had locked the canonical phrasing at "20 core" and
  was not re-run after Phase C. Result: plugin.json, marketplace.json,
  README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md all under-claimed
  by one. Reconciled to "25 sub-skills (21 core + 1 orchestrator + 1 framework
  integration + 2 extension mirrors)".

### Added
- **`tests/test_manifest_consistency.py`**: pytest suite that asserts
  plugin.json + marketplace.json claimed counts match the actual on-disk
  count of `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/seo-*.md`, that plugin.json and
  marketplace.json descriptions agree on the canonical math, that user-visible
  docs (README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) reference the same skill count, and that
  plugin.json `version` and CITATION.cff `version` triangulate. Closes the
  systemic gap that allowed two skill-count drift incidents in v1.9.7.
- **`pytest tests/` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: runs the new manifest
  consistency suite on every push to main and every pull request, gating
  future skill additions behind matching documentation updates.

### Changed
- **`uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` now use glob enumeration** rather than a
  hardcoded skill list. The previous scripts had been frozen at v1.4.0-era
  state and missed 12 sub-skills and 11 sub-agents added between v1.5 and
  v1.9.8 (`seo-backlinks`, `seo-cluster`, `seo-content-brief`, `seo-dataforseo`,
  `seo-drift`, `seo-ecommerce`, `seo-flow`, `seo-google`, `seo-image-gen`,
  `seo-local`, `seo-maps`, `seo-sxo` and the corresponding agents). Anyone who
  ran the old uninstaller got half a cleanup. Glob enumeration auto-tracks
  future skill additions without requiring uninstaller maintenance. Sandbox
  test confirms the new scripts remove every `seo` and `seo-*` skill plus
  every `seo-*.md` agent while leaving sibling skills (e.g. `blog-writer`,
  `security`) untouched.
- This release rolls forward two commits that landed on main after the v1.9.7
  tag was cut:
  - `8514999`: marketplace metadata polish (added `category: "marketing"`,
    `homepage: https://claude-seo.md`, and a 14-keyword array to the
    marketplace.json plugin entry). The `author` object for the plugin entry
    was intentionally scoped here too but did not land in this commit; it
    lands in v1.9.9 (issue #92).
  - `66a7485`: em-dash sweep on user-visible AGENTS.md and CHANGELOG.md
  Both were intentionally scoped at v1.9.7 but landed post-tag. v1.9.8 captures
  them properly.

## [1.9.7] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Skill-count drift across 5 manifests**: `plugin.json` ("20 core sub-skills"),
  `marketplace.json` ("21 core sub-skills"), `CLAUDE.md` line 7 ("21 core sub-skills"),
  `AGENTS.md` line 8 ("20 core sub-skills") + line 84 ("23 skills"), and `README.md`
  line 7 ("21 core sub-skills") all contradicted each other. Reconciled to canonical
  phrasing: "24 sub-skills (20 core + 1 orchestrator + 1 framework integration +
  2 extension mirrors)".
- **Sub-agent count drift**: `CLAUDE.md` claimed "16 core subagents (+ 2 extension
  agents, 18 total)" while `AGENTS.md` claimed "15 core subagents (+ 2 extension
  agents, 17 total)". Reconciled to: "18 sub-agents (15 core + 1 framework integration +
  2 extension mirrors)".
- **`CLAUDE.md` self-contradiction**: line 23 stated `plugin.json (v1.9.0)`; updated
  to current `v1.9.7`.
- **`marketplace.json` description fields**: both `metadata.description` (top-level)
  and `plugins[0].description` now use canonical phrasing.
- **`CITATION.cff` version drift**: was stuck at `1.8.2` (six minor versions behind);
  bumped to match `plugin.json` at `1.9.7` with current release date.

### Added
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`**: weekly Dependabot updates for pip and GitHub Actions
  ecosystems (closes supply-chain hygiene gap).
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Contributor Covenant 2.1, closing GitHub Community
  Standards gap.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `permissions:` block**: restricts `GITHUB_TOKEN` to
  `contents: read` at workflow root (least-privilege; was previously default scope).

### Changed
- Patch release driven by repository hygiene + marketplace-readiness preparation.
  No skill behavior changes, no breaking changes, no script changes.

### Removed
- **`translations/uk/`**: the Ukrainian localization (originally contributed by
  @edocltd in PR #50, shipped in v1.9.0) has been retired. The translation drifted
  across v1.9.0 to v1.9.7 with no maintenance signal, and a partially translated set
  is worse than no translation at all when readers cannot tell what is current.
  @edocltd's contribution remains credited in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. If a maintained
  translation is desired in the future, it should land via a contributor who can
  commit to keeping it in sync release over release.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-04-26

### Security
- **VULN-A01 (HIGH):** Removed `Bash` from `seo-flow` agent tool grant, agent no
  longer has shell access, eliminating prompt-injection-to-shell attack surface
- **VULN-A02/A07 (MEDIUM/LOW):** Switched `sync_flow.py` to anonymous-first GitHub API
  requests; PAT only used as 403-triggered fallback, eliminates token-on-redirect leak
- **VULN-A03 (MEDIUM):** Added `Path.resolve()` containment check in `record_write()`,
  blocks path-traversal writes outside the skill reference directory
- **VULN-A04 (MEDIUM):** Introduced `flow-prompts.lock` SHA-256 baseline file; sync now
  diffs against baseline and reports upstream drift before writing
- **VULN-A05 (MEDIUM):** Added explicit "WebFetch is untrusted" security rule to agent
  body, agent warned not to execute or relay fetched content verbatim
- **VULN-A06 (LOW):** `gh` CLI absence now degrades to anonymous API rather than
  hard-exiting, sync works without gh CLI on public repos
- **VULN-A08 (LOW):** All file writes are now atomic (tempfile + shutil.move),
  eliminates partial-write corruption on interrupt
- **VULN-A09 (LOW):** GitHub API responses capped at 5 MB with 15s timeout,
  prevents memory exhaustion from malformed or oversized API payloads
- **VULN-A10 (LOW):** URL allowlist validates every request targets `api.github.com`
  over HTTPS, blocks SSRF if `API_ROOT` constant is modified
- **INFO-A14:** Added CC BY 4.0 attribution header to `references/prompts/README.md`

### Tests
- Added 10 new unit/integration tests covering all above findings
- Test count: 5 → 15

## [1.9.5] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **seo-flow**: FLOW framework integration, Find → Leverage → Optimize → Win. 41 evidence-led AI prompts (CC BY 4.0) bundled as `skills/seo-flow/references/prompts/` (find:5, leverage:1, optimize:21, win:3, local:11). Commands: `/seo flow [find|leverage|optimize|win|local|prompts|sync]`.
- **Context-matching orchestration**: `/seo flow optimize` selects 2-3 most relevant prompts from 21 based on URL industry signals and prior skill output, not a full dump.
- **`scripts/sync_flow.py`**: GitHub API sync script, pulls latest FLOW prompts, framework doc, and bibliography from AgriciDaniel/flow. Supports `--dry-run` and `--ref <sha>` pinning. Outputs JSON summary.
- **`agents/seo-flow.md`**: FLOW subagent, applies stage prompts to target URLs, returns structured evidence-tagged findings.
- **FLOW cross-references**: Integration notes added to seo-geo, seo-local, seo-content, and seo-cluster skills.

### License
- FLOW content bundled under CC BY 4.0. Attribution header on every prompt file (automated by `sync_flow.py`). Claude SEO's MIT license unchanged, applies to skill code only.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **seo-cluster**: SERP-based semantic topic clustering for content architecture (skill + 3 references + interactive cluster-map.html visualization + agent). Contributed by Lutfiya Miller (Pro Hub Challenge Winner).
- **seo-sxo**: Search Experience Optimization, reads SERPs backwards to detect page-type mismatches, derives user stories, scores pages from persona perspectives (skill + 4 references + agent). Contributed by Florian Schmitz.
- **seo-drift**: SEO drift monitoring, baseline, diff, and track changes to on-page SEO with 17 comparison rules across 3 severity levels. SQLite persistence (skill + 1 reference + agent + 4 Python scripts). Contributed by Dan Colta. Security-hardened: all curl usage eliminated, SSRF protection enforced.
- **seo-ecommerce**: E-commerce SEO, Google Shopping intelligence, Amazon marketplace analysis, product schema validation (skill + 1 reference + agent + 2 Python scripts). Contributed by Matej Marjanovic.
- **DataForSEO cost guardrails**: `scripts/dataforseo_costs.py` with threshold-based approval, session budget tracking, daily spend summaries. `references/cost-tiers.md` pricing table. Contributed by Matej Marjanovic.
- **seo-hreflang cultural profiles**: 4 cultural adaptation profiles (DACH, Francophone, Hispanic, Japanese) with locale format tables, content parity audit, and freshness tracking. 3 new reference files. Contributed by Chris Muller.
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md**: Community credits file for Pro Hub Challenge and PR contributors
- **AGENTS.md**: Multi-platform discovery file for Cursor/Antigravity (concept by Matej Marjanovic, rewritten for v1.9.0)
- **Schema templates**: Product (Full E-commerce) and ItemList (hub/pillar pages) added to `schema/templates.json`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Security
- **Install script supply chain fix**: Replaced `irm | iex` Windows PowerShell one-liner with `git clone + powershell -File` as primary install method. Claude Code's own security guardrails flagged the old pattern as a supply chain risk (reported by community member). Added collapsible "review before running" section for Unix curl method.
- **Version pinning**: `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now clone a specific release tag (`v1.3.0`) by default rather than `main`, preventing silent updates. Override with `CLAUDE_SEO_TAG=main`.
- **PowerShell Invoke-External hardening**: Comprehensive `PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference` handling in `Invoke-External` wrapper (fixes Windows git clone stderr false-positive termination, from PR #13 + PR #15).

### Added
- **GEO agent deployed**: `agents/seo-geo.md` created -- `/seo audit` now spawns 7 parallel agents (was 6). GEO analysis covers AI crawler access, llms.txt, passage-level citability, brand mention signals, platform-specific scoring (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Bing Copilot).
- **`--googlebot` flag in `fetch_page.py`**: Detect prerender/dynamic rendering services by comparing response size with default UA vs Googlebot UA. First phase of SPA/CSR support (Issue #11).

### Fixed
- **URL normalization**: `capture_screenshot.py` and `analyze_visual.py` now accept bare domains (`example.com` -> `https://example.com`) via shared `normalize_url()` helper (from PR #16 by @shuofengzhang).
- **GEO weight**: AI Search Readiness weight increased from 5% to 10% in overall SEO Health Score. Technical SEO adjusted to 22%, Content Quality to 23%.
- **FAQPage guidance**: Blanket "remove FAQPage on commercial sites" updated to nuanced guidance -- existing FAQPage -> Info priority (not Critical), noting AI/LLM citation benefit. Adding new FAQPage -> not recommended for Google, note AI benefit. Updated in `seo/SKILL.md`, `agents/seo-schema.md`, `seo/references/schema-types.md`.
- **Uninstall agents list**: Added `seo-geo` to `uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` removal lists.
- **Python requirement**: Corrected from `3.8+` to `3.10+` in `README.md` and `docs/INSTALLATION.md`.

### Changed
- Subagent count: 6 -> 7 (added seo-geo to core audit pipeline)
- `.gitignore`: Added generated audit artifacts (charts/, PDFs, report.html, firebase-debug.log, generated-schema.json)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

- **SSRF prevention**: Added to `capture_screenshot.py` (defense-in-depth, matching `fetch_page.py`)
- **Frontmatter cleanup**: Removed non-standard `allowed-tools` from main SKILL.md

### Changed
- Sub-skill count: 12 + 1 extension (added seo-dataforseo via DataForSEO extension)
- Subagent count: 6 + 1 optional (added seo-dataforseo agent via extension)
- DataForSEO promoted from "Community" to "Official extension" in MCP docs

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **User-Agent header**: Changed default from bot-style `ClaudeSEO/1.0` to Chrome-like string with `ClaudeSEO/1.2` suffix. SSR frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Angular) now pre-render properly instead of serving empty client-side shells (#9)
- **Custom User-Agent support**: Added `--user-agent` flag to `fetch_page.py` for configurable UA strings

### Fixed
- **YAML frontmatter parsing**: Removed HTML comments before `---` delimiter in 8 files (skills: seo-content, seo-images, seo-programmatic, seo-schema, seo-technical; agents: seo-content, seo-performance, seo-technical). Thanks @kylewhirl for identifying this in the codex-seo fork.
- **Windows installer**: Merged @kfrancis improvements -- `python3 -m pip`, `py -3` launcher fallback, requirements.txt persistence, non-fatal subagent copy, better error diagnostics (PR #6)
- **requirements.txt missing after install**: Now copied to skill directory so users can retry (#1)

### Changed
- Python dependencies now installed in a venv at `~/.claude/skills/seo/.venv/` with `--user` fallback (#2)
- Playwright marked as explicitly optional in install output
- Windows installer uses `Resolve-Python` helper for robust Python detection (#5)
