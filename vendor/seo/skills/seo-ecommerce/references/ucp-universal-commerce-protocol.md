# UCP: Universal Commerce Protocol (September 2026)

UCP is a Google-initiated open standard, co-developed with Shopify, Etsy,
Wayfair, Target, and Walmart (20+ endorsers), plus payment partners (Stripe,
Visa, Mastercard, Adyen, Amex). Its purpose: let **AI agents discover,
negotiate, and transact with merchants without one-off integrations**. It is
interoperable with **A2A** (Agent2Agent), **AP2** (Agent Payments Protocol),
and **MCP**.

For commerce sites, UCP sits next to **Google Merchant Center feeds** and
**Google Business Profile** as the third leg of agent-era discovery. Google
confirms a first reference implementation for conversational buying in AI Mode
in Search; broader Universal Cart rollout details are reported from Google I/O
2026 keynote coverage; not confirmed on a Google-owned source.

**Primary sources (canonical, stable):**
- Google merchant developer guide: https://developers.google.com/merchant/ucp
  (and /merchant/ucp/guides/ucp-profile)
- Spec / overview: https://ucp.dev. Versions are dates (YYYY-MM-DD). ucp.dev lists **2026-08-25** as the latest spec release; Google's merchant
  implementation guide still documents **2026-04-08**, and live profiles list
  older releases under `supported_versions` (checked 2026-09-23).

## What UCP is and isn't

| What it is | What it isn't |
|---|---|
| A capability-declaration + negotiation protocol | A new payment processor |
| Transport-agnostic (REST, MCP, A2A) | A replacement for Merchant Center feeds |
| Compatible with AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) for cryptographic user-consent proof on autonomous purchases | A way to skip being merchant of record |
| Google reference implementation for conversational buying in AI Mode in Search | A "ranking factor" because Google has not framed it that way |

Merchants stay **Merchant of Record** under UCP; they keep customer
relationships and post-purchase ownership.

## How to declare a UCP profile

Publish a business profile at `/.well-known/ucp`. Everything sits under a root
`ucp` object; `services` and `capabilities` are keyed by reverse-domain name,
each holding a list of version variants (shape from
https://ucp.dev/latest/specification/overview/, checked 2026-09-23 against a
live Shopify profile):

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "2026-08-25",
    "supported_versions": {"2026-04-08": "https://shop.example/.well-known/ucp/2026-04-08"},
    "services": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping": [
        {"version": "2026-08-25", "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-08-25/specification/overview/",
         "transport": "mcp", "endpoint": "https://shop.example/api/ucp/mcp",
         "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-08-25/services/shopping/mcp.openrpc.json"}
      ]
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout": [
        {"version": "2026-08-25",
         "spec": "https://ucp.dev/2026-08-25/specification/shopping/checkout/",
         "schema": "https://ucp.dev/2026-08-25/schemas/shopping/checkout.json"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

A capability variant needs `version`, `spec` and `schema` (optional `extends`,
`config`); a service variant also needs a `transport` (`rest`, `mcp`, `a2a` or
`embedded`) and usually an `endpoint`. There is no `merchant` field. A literal
`"1.0"` is not a UCP release. Platforms (AI Mode in Search, Gemini) discover the
profile and negotiate a version.

### Integration paths

- **Native checkout** (default): full agentic potential; the recommended path.
- **Embedded checkout** (optional, iframe-based): for specific Google-approved
  merchants with complex/bespoke checkout.

Merchants join a **waitlist** (interest form linked from developers.google.com/merchant/ucp) before going live.

## Common capabilities to declare

| Capability ID (shape) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` | Initiate checkout, return totals + payment intent |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment` | Quote shipping options and delivery windows |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.discount` | Apply promo codes / loyalty discounts at quote time |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.cart` | Add / remove / update items in agent-managed carts |

Exact identifiers are governed by the live spec. The namespace pattern is
`dev.ucp.<domain>.<verb>`; version values are date-based.

## What claude-seo audits

`/seo ecommerce <url>` should report:

1. **Presence:** does `/.well-known/ucp` resolve to a valid JSON document?
2. **Capability coverage:** which capabilities are declared? Flag missing
   checkout / fulfillment / discount as opportunities, not failures (the
   protocol is early).
3. **Endpoint reachability:** are declared service endpoints HTTPS, valid TLS,
   not returning 5xx? (`ucp_check.py --probe-endpoints`)
4. **Version coherence:** is `ucp.version` a date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) UCP release?
   2026-08-25 is the latest spec, and 2026-04-08 is what Google's merchant guide
   documents; both are valid. Flag a literal `"1.0"` or a non-date version.
5. **Integration path:** does the profile imply Native (default) or Embedded
   (approved-merchant) checkout?

The audit should **not** score the absence of UCP as a critical failure; frame
it as an opportunity, especially for merchants already on Google Merchant
Center. (UCP itself is live; what's "early" is broad merchant adoption.)

## How UCP interacts with existing surfaces

| Existing surface | Relationship to UCP |
|---|---|
| Google Merchant Center feed | Google's guide builds on existing Merchant Center shopping feeds for discovery |
| Google Business Profile | Independent: UCP is product / order; GBP is store / location |
| Product schema (`hasMerchantReturnPolicy`, `shippingDetails`) | Complementary: UCP exposes the same data at the API layer; schema exposes it at the page layer |
| AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) | Pair. UCP handles discovery + checkout structure; AP2 handles cryptographic proof of user consent. Treat FIDO governance, v0.2, and Mastercard Verifiable Intent details as secondary-source context, not canonical audit guidance until primary sources verify them. |

A merchant that already has clean Merchant Center feeds, complete Product
schema, and a checkout API can declare a UCP profile in a sprint.

## Audit posture

- **Tier 1 (e-commerce sites already on Merchant Center):** recommend
  declaring a UCP profile as a forward-looking opportunity.
- **Tier 2 (DTC sites not on Merchant Center):** do not recommend UCP yet;
  Merchant Center is the prerequisite to most flows.
- **Tier 3 (informational / B2B sites):** ignore UCP, but **do not** blanket-
  exclude hospitality/restaurant sites: UCP is expanding to **Lodging and Food**
  verticals (hotel booking in AI Mode, food delivery via Google Maps).

## Current rollout & landscape (2026)

- **Universal Cart** rollout details beyond AI Mode in Search are reported from
  Google I/O 2026 keynote coverage; not confirmed on a Google-owned source.
  Treat Gemini app, YouTube/Gmail, country expansion, and retailer lists as
  hedged context. Confirmed audit guidance remains Merchant Center eligibility,
  clean product data, and `/.well-known/ucp` readiness for AI Mode in Search.
- **GML 2026 (2026-05-20):** BNPL (Affirm, Klarna) in Google Pay; **Direct
  Offers** + Shopping ads on YouTube enabling instant purchase for UCP-integrated
  brands; AI performance insights + Ask Advisor in Merchant Center.
- **Holiday shopping update (2026-09-16):** AI performance insights are now available
  for English-language queries on accounts in Australia, Canada, India, New
  Zealand and the US, and cover organic AI traffic only (paid Ads traffic
  excluded). The UCP integration hub added cart transfer to the merchant site
  and checkout flow testing, rolling out gradually in the US.
- **Landscape:** UCP is one of three agentic-checkout protocols: alongside
  **OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** (its consumer Instant Checkout was
  pulled early March 2026) and **Microsoft Copilot** checkout via Shopify
  (2026-01-08). Keep ACP/Copilot as *secondary*-sourced context.

## Last verified

2026-09-23. Re-check when:

- A new dated UCP spec supersedes 2026-08-25, or Google's merchant guide moves past 2026-04-08.
- AP2 advances past v0.2 / FIDO governance milestones change.
- UCP expands to new verticals or new surfaces (beyond Search, Gemini, YouTube, Gmail).
